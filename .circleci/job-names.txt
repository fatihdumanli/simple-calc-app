A job must have one of `docker`, `machine`, `macos` or `executor` 
(which can provide docker/machine/macos information).

---------------------
If you are using Workflows, jobs must have a name that is unique within the .circleci/config.yml file.

If you are not using workflows, the jobs map must contain a job named build. This build job is the default entry-point for a run that is triggered by a push to your VCS provider. It is possible to then specify additional jobs and run them using the CircleCI API

You are not using workflows â€¦hence cannot use arbitrary job names.
